However, not knowing Node.js or GraphQL, learning the additional finesses of Gatsby.js has been cumbersome. </p>\n<p>Therefore, I have decided to start on the preliminary Gatsby <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial\">tutorial</a> in order to get a ground-up understanding. </p>\n<p>So far, the tutorial haven’t really helped too much, but I was introduced to the static webhosting service called <a href=\"https://surge.sh\">Surge</a>. It is extremely fast and easy to use, and even offers (without SSL-certificate) custom domain names. This is all that is needed to download, create user and deploy. All done in less than a minute. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"> <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --global surge\n surge login\n gatsby build\n surge public/ solberg.ws\n  project: ~/git/blog/public/\n   domain: solberg.ws\n   upload: <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token operator\">==</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\nSuccess<span class=\"token operator\">!</span> Published and running at solberg.ws</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project Blog - Stumbling over Surge","date":"31.
