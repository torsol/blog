The blog wasn’t really getting any attention from me in the fall, but I truly hope that I can have some fun documenting my master thesis writing this semester. </p>\n<p>This week, I have been talking to my supervisors, getting all the logistics in order. The plan is to start my preliminary work tomorrow, on monday the 11. of january. The final deadline for the project will be the 11. of june, giving me 5 months for the final work. </p>\n<p>As for the blog, I have removed some  of the sections, keeping to the core theme of it being a blog. Will also be posting in english, as it feels more natural due to the coding nature of the content, and I need to improve my english writing skills. I hope to share some cool projects here going forward. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Master Thesis - The Start","date":"10.
